# Darkest Days

A GMod gamemode that is a mix of Half-Life 2 Deathmath, Bioshock Multiplayer, Dishonored and a few other fast paced round-based games.

# Features

## Gametypes and maps

- 5 different round based gametypes featuring: King of the Hill, Team Deathmatch, Free for All, Hold the Flag and an obnoxious survival-like mode against the local bosses of the gym.
- Support for over 70+ Half-Life 2 Deathmatch and Counter-Strike: Source maps, with the ability to add "almost" any map support with the help of in-game map profile editing tools.

## Player customization

- 3 skill trees for melee, magic and ranged playstyles. Each tree gives you a bunch of passive goodies and active skills.
- On top of that you can pick one of the three mini builds to nudge the stats into desired direction even more.
- Over 30+ melee weapons and guns, which also include some weird weapons.
- Over 15+ various spells for movement, elemental damage, teamwork and stuff.
- There are perks too!
- 3 loadout slots with the quick select/preview options.
- Additional menu (F4) to change crosshair, some bindings and other QoL settings.

## Parkour

- Custom made parkour system that is mostly inspired by the smooth movement of Titanfall 2.
- Allows for wall running/jumping, sliding, ledge grabbing and max-payne like diving.
- Intuitive controls, no over-the-top zooming around the map* and no scary Patreon-locked .dll modules.
(* - some exceptions may apply)

## Gore, effects and other visual goodies

- As with all my gamemodes - this one has yet another custom-made dismemberment system, which is a mix of stencil/model mask culling combined with fancy Source Particle System effects.
- It is heavily integrated with the gun/melee weapon base for the best gunplay/impact feel, which is one of the reasons why I cant simply rip it out to be a separate addon on workshop.
